Diagnosis: Lymphoma.



Reason: Follow-up.



Comparison: Comparison made to the CT part of PET CT scan dated 2 February 2021.





Findings:



Neck CT with IV contrast:



There are unchanged enlarged hypoattenuating left cervical lymph nodes the large

st seen at levels III measuring 1 cm in short axis.



There are unchanged mildly enlarged right supraclavicular lymph nodes, none exce

eding 1 cm in short axis.



There is no new cervical lymph node enlargement.



Chest CT with IV contrast:



There are unchanged multiple hypoattenuating conglomerate mediastinal lymph node

s are encasing the aortic arch and its major branches with no significant narrow

ing, for example the subcarinal lymph node measures 2 cm in short axis with no s

ignificant change.



There is no new intrathoracic lymph node enlargement.



There is no significant axillary lymph node enlargement.



The mild pericardial thickening/effusion appears less significant.



There is a new trace amount of right pleural effusion.



There is no significant left pleural effusion.



There is no pulmonary nodule/mass.



There is no pulmonary consolidation.



Abdomen and pelvis CT scan with contrast:



Normal liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and both kidneys.



There is no hydronephrosis bilaterally.



Unremarkable gallbladder.



There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary tree dilatation.



There is no significant retroperitoneal or pelvic lymph node enlargement.



There is no ascites.



Unremarkable urinary bladder outline.



There is no vertebral collapse.



Impression:



There has been no significant interval change regarding the hypoattenuating resi

dual lymph nodes seen above the diaphragm compared to the CT part of PET/CT scan

 dated 2 February 2021.

Procedure:



""Images were acquired from vertex to the knees (standard protocol) caudocraniall

y 88 minutes after IV injection of  132 MBq F18-FDG dose. Axial, sagittal, and c

oronal PET reconstruction were interpreted with and without attenuation correcti

on. Corresponding CT images without IV contrast were also acquired in a Biograph

 mCT flow 64 slices CT, reconstructed in axial, sagittal and coronal planes, and

 reviewed alongside the PET images. The CT images were used for attenuation corr

ection and anatomical correlation of the PET images. Fasting blood sugar at the 

injection time was 96 mg/dl Patient weight is 44 kg.
