Diagnosis: Chondrosarcoma.



Reason: Follow-up.



Comparison: Previous MRI dated 25 May 2021.



Findings:



Whole spine MRI with IV contrast:



The overall appearances are suggestive of disease progression manifested by:



- mild interval increase in the size of the multiple vertebral lesions.



- increase in the extraosseous soft tissue extension associated with T3, T9 and 

to a lesser extent T6, this is most significant at T9 level where it results in 

anterior epidural soft tissue extension and mild spinal canal narrowing compress

ing and deforming the right aspect of the spinal cord with however visualised CS

F surrounding the spinal cord (epidural spinal cord compression grade II), at T3

 level, the epidural extension is causing mild spinal canal narrowing, indenting

 the spinal cord (grade IC epidural spinal cord compression).



- there is increase in the extraosseous soft tissue component associated with th

e right third rib.



- there are multiple destructive pelvic bony lesion with large extraosseous soft

 tissue extension associated with the right iliac bone and the left sacral masse

s.



There is unchanged multilevel mild vertebral loss of height.



There is no abnormal intrinsic spinal cord signal or intrinsic spinal cord contr

ast enhancing lesion.



There is no spinal cord compression.



Impression:



The overall appearances are consistent with disease progression manifested by en

larging vertebral metastatic lesions and the associated extraosseous soft tissue

 extension.

 right breast



The patient had ultrasound done outside recently recommended biopsy       



Compared to previous examination from April 2020



MLO views of both  breasts  were obtained.



Magnification views obtained as well.



Findings: 



The breast tissues are heterogeneously dense. This somewhat lowers the detection

 ability of mammogram.



No significant interval change in the appearance of the breast since the previou

s study.



There is partially obscured lobulated mass with calcification at the upper mid l

eft breast unchanged compared to previous examination likely benign.



There is post biopsy clip at the mid lower periareolar right breast.



There is no evidence of suspicious masses .



There is no evidence of clustered microcalcification 



BILATERAL   BREAST US



Heterogeneous echo texture of the breasts.



Left breast:



There is lobulated hypoechoic mass at 11 o'clock measure 9 x 6 x 9 mm unchanged 

compared to previous examination correlate with the calcification likely benign.





There is oval hypoechoic mass at 3 o'clock measure 7 x 3  mm likely benign.



There is lobulated hypoechoic mass at 12 o'clock measure 5 x 3 mm unchanged comp

ared to previous examination



Right breast:



Post biopsy clip at 6 o'clock periareolar



No axillary lymphadenopathy.



Impression:



Lobulated mass with calcification in the left breast unchanged.



Likely benign masses in the left breast



Post biopsy clip in the right breast



LEVEL OF CONCERN:

No liver metastases could be identified.



There is a stable haemangioma in segment IV of the liver, measuring about 2.9 cm

 in axial diameters.



No enlarged lymph nodes in the porta hepatis or in the retroperitoneal space are

 seen.



A small uncomplicated gallbladder stone is noted.  Bile ducts are unremarkable. 

 Pancreas, spleen, adrenals and both kidneys are within the normal appearances.



No mass lesion at the site of colorectal anastomosis to account for local recurr

ence of cancer is seen.  There is a persistent subtle nodular stranding in the b

ed of the resected left colon which showed no metabolic activity on the most rec

ent PET CT scan dated on 16 May 2021.  Therefore, these changes are most probabl

y related to surgery and represent fibrotic changes.  Uncomplicated diverticulos

is of the colon is seen.  No ascites is noted.



No pelvic organ pathology is noted.



Impression:



-No local recurrence of colon cancer.
