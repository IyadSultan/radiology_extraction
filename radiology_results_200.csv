 mCT flow 64 slices CT, reconstructed in axial, sagittal and coronal planes, and

 reviewed alongside the PET images. The CT images were used for attenuation corr

ection and anatomical correlation of the PET images. Fasting blood sugar at the 

injection time was 98 mg/dl Patient weight is 72 kg.  



Comparison: With previous PET/CT scan performed on 31.12.2020.



Findings:



Head and neck: 



- Newly seen hypermetabolic multiple left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, along

 with metabolic progression in the previously seen small hypermetabolic left sup

raclavicular lymph node, currently the most prominent one is measuring about 1.7

 cm in its active component with SUVmax= 9.6.

- Newly seen multiple hypermetabolic mediastinal lymphadenopathy, involving: sub

carinal , aorto-pulmonary window, left prehila and left peribrochial lymph nodes

, the most prominent one is the subcarinal lymph node measuring 1.2dcm with SUVm

ax=4.9.



- Metabolic progression in the previously mentioned hypermetabolic bilateral hil

ar lymph nodes, more on the left side, with current SUVmax= 4.5 vs 2.2 previousl

y.



- More or less stable previously mentioned hypermetabolic bilateral axillary lym

ph nodes with preserved hilum, more prominent on the left side with current SUVm

ax=2 vs 1.2 previously.



- Stable few tiny lung nodules in the superior segment of left lower lobe latera

lly and right lower lobe, not showing FDG uptake, (beyond resolution of PET scan

).



- Physiologic myocardial FDG metabolic activity.

RIGHT DIAGNOSTIC DIGITAL MAMMOGRM



Clinical history: 51  year-old female, had history of left breast cancer status 

post mastectomy and wide local excision in the right breast for DCIS.



Compared to prior mammogram dated back to 2014.



CC and  MLO views of right  breast  were obtained.



Findings: 



The breast tissues are heterogeneously dense. This somewhat lowers the detection

 ability of mammogram.



No significant interval change.



Minimal postoperative changes at central right breast.



Stable isodense oval mass with the partially circumscribed outline at mid slight

ly upper right breast.



There is no evidence of suspicious masses .



There is no evidence of clustered microcalcification .



Impression:



Minimal postoperative changes in the right breast.



Stable benign looking mass.



LEVEL OF CONCERN: 



BI-RADS 2- benign finding (benign, no malignant features; routine followup)



Recommendation:



Mammogram  after 12 months .



Breast MRI is advised after 6 months.. 



The patient was informed with the results and recommendation.



Dr. Heba Farfoura.

Clinical history: Lung cancer for preoperative assessment



Comparison: Previous images dated back to June 22, 2021.



Findings:



Unchanged centrally located lobulated soft tissue mass lesion seen in the right 

upper lobe encasing the right upper bronchus and abutting the right pulmonary ar

tery and the superior vena cava with no evidence of thrombosis on invasion.  It 

is measuring 5 X 6.5 in cross-section.



The tumor is obstructing the anterior bronchial segment of the right upper bronc

hus with secondary collapse of the corresponding anterior segment. 



The right upper pulmonary vein is encased by the mass at its periphery.



No other suspicious pulmonary nodules.



Unchanged small right paratracheal and precarinal lymph nodes.



No pleural or pericardial effusions.



No gross axillary lymph node enlargement.



Normal heart size.



Degenerative changes of the visualised spine but no vertebral collapse.



Unchanged small nodular thickening in the body of the left adrenal gland of low 

density, probably representing  adenoma.



The right adrenal and the visualised part of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
